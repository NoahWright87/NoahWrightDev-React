            I'm a software engineer with humble beginnings.  I got my first programming job by automating my way out of tedious computer work.
            I went from a temp employee to the start-up's first full-time software engineer, and it was there that I learned that code wasn't
            just what made my favorite video games work -- it was a tool for improving people's lives.

            From there, my software career took a winding path through the Air Force, Google, and a variety of different industries.  Throughtout
            my journey, I've learned that the most important part of software isn't the code itself, but the people who use it.  My job exists to
            make <em>other</em> jobs easier, and I take great pride in that.  Every stop along my way, I try to adhere to the general rule:

            I know I can't change the world, but I can at least tidy things up as I go.  To me, that means writing the best code I can, trying
            my best to deliver value to my customers, teaching my kids to avoid the mistakes I ran into, and treating the people around me with
            respect.
