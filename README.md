# Noah Wright's developer site
ğŸš§ğŸš§ This is a work in progress! ğŸš§ğŸš§

My website that is currently at noahwright.dev was made from a template made by somebody else.  This time
I wanted to create something from scratch using React.  That way I'll know the site inside and out, and I'll be able to try various
React things in the comfort of a very small site.
