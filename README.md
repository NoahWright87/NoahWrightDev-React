# Noah Wright's developer site
ðŸš§ðŸš§ This is a work in progress! ðŸš§ðŸš§

My website that is currently at noahwright.dev was made from a template made by somebody else.  This time
I wanted to create something from scratch using React.  That way I'll know the site inside and out, and I'll be able to try various
React things in the comfort of a very small site.


## TODO

This React-based site is a little bit janky because I was "shooting from the hip" while making it.  It needs to
get cleaned up before I push it out to the web.  I'll list future work here.

### MVP

This is what needs to be done before first publishing the React-based version of the site.

- Some pages scroll horizontally for no particular reason?
- Resume page.
    - Add Signify Health to the page itself.
    - Update resume with Signify Health info.
        - Need logo
    - Links at the top don't follow styling.
- Fill in some posts so there isn't a HUGE gap.
- Blog posts
    - Prev/next buttons at the bottom look awkward.
        - IDEA: Make a "mini" PostSnippet that is used here instead?
        - IDEA2: Remove it, do something later??
    - Tags section could look better.
    - Main text should be bigger, easier to read.
- Project page
    - Snippets should include links in the bottom-left (opposite the skill chits).
    - Each project just has "lorem ipsum" nonsense right now.
    - Maybe have more than 2 projects??
- Color scheme
    - Remove everything, make the whole site straight-up black-and-white.
    - Create color-picker component that can change color on-the-fly.  Put it in top menu and play with it.
- General clean-up
    - Put styling info into actual CSS files.


### Backlog

Features I'd like to add long-term will go here.

- Paginated blog post list.
- Animation between pages.
- Support for "asides".  Format would be: `This is an ^aside^(this text shows up on hover/click).`
