I’ve been listening to the Working Code podcast and really liked their suggestion to learn in public and use blogging 
as a way to remember things.  So here I am, writing a blog.

My plan is to write semi-regularly on here - even if it’s just a small post - about any kinds of problems or 
challenges I’m facing in my day-to-day life.  Those could be technical, personal, or anything in-between.  Hopefully 
someone out there gets some use out of my documented stream-of-consciousness.

Also, today I was looking back on old Facebook posts and pictures and seeing what a goober I was 20 years ago.  I wish 
I had dev blogs from back then, when I was first starting out, that I could go back and cringe at.  I've been messing 
with software for so long that it's easy to forget where I came from.  I know there were areas where I struggled 
**hard** that are a piece of cake now, but there's no record of that.  I'd love to look back, see my awful code and 
lack of understanding, and have perspective on how I've grown.
