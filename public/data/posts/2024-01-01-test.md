TODO: Make a tl;dr box here.  What will the symbols be?


# This is a post
A post with all sorts of markdown.  We've got:

- Bulleted lists!
- *Italics!*
- **Bold!!**
- ***Bold AND italics!***
- ~Strikes~ work?
- We have [links to things](www.google.com).
- What about $[affiliate links](www.amazon.com)??
- And what about [curly braces afterwards](www.google.com).
- Can I [do square brackets]<gator brackets>(parentheses.com).
- Maybe if we use [component to find affiliate links?](https://affiliate.amazon.com/some-product).
- And tell the difference between [internal link](/blog/2022-09-03-six-months-at-google.md) and [external links](http://www.google.com)??
- And links to [other posts](2021-12-11-imposter-syndrome.md).
- I can even have ^asides^(like this one).

Plus we can have quotes, like this one:

@@Blah blah blah, important stuff.@@(Some guy)

Can I do code blocks?  Let's see...

```csharp
public static void main(string[] args) {
    Console.WriteLine("hello world");
}
```

or without a code specified:

```
C:\
C:\spot
C:\spot\run.exe
run\spot\run
```

TL;DRs at the top?

```tldr
- thing 1
- thing 2
- thing c
```


Quotes:

```quote
Ab-so-lutely don't trust everything you read on the internet.

-Abraham Lincoln
```

Can we do a break?

Or is it 3 dashes??

How about that?
