A post with to make sure various kinds of markdown appear correctly.

## In-line markdown

- Bulleted lists!
- *Italics!*

- Links look different based on context.
    - [Internal links](/blog/2022-09-03-six-months-at-google.md) look normal.
    - [External links](http://www.google.com) show an arrow.
    - [Affiliate links](https://affiliate.amazon.com/some-product) say they're ads.
- I'd like to be able to do ^asides^(like this one).
