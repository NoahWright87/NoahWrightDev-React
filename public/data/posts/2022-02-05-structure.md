You know that one interview question everybody hates?  The one I you've probably read multiple articles about how to answer?  That one that has you wondering, "how honest should I be here?"  C'mon, you know the one.

> What's your biggest weakness?

That's it!  I'm not going to write yet another article about how to answer it.  Instead, I'll tell you *my* answer.

**Structure**.

I need it.  It helps me focus, keeps me from being distracted, and makes me overall more productive.  There's just one problem: **I hate making structure for myself!**

Put me on a team that has defined sprint goals and well-written tickets, give me a deadline to hit, and off I go.  I'll grab a ticket, do the work, submit a pull request, update the ticket, and move on to the next one.  Working on a well-organized team showed me that I can work a lot faster than I thought was possible, all thanks to structure.

This is in stark contrast to how I approach personal projects.  Usually, I just start coding.  Hours into that coding, and I haven't actually produced that much code.  The code I did produced is probably not that important - I almost always go down a rabbit hole that doesn't really matter much - and I ultimately end up abandoning whatever the project is.

Why the difference?

This is a bit of self-reflection that I got into, believe or not, because of that interview question.  Why is it my weakness?  Why don't I organize things?  Here's what I decided: organizing my work does not feel like work.  It doesn't feel productive.  Taking it away from programming, I realize this is a common flaw in my whole life.  I love having a checklist.  I look at my list, complete some task, and then get the satisfaction of checking it off.  But making the checklist?  *That doesn't accomplish anything*, I think.  *I should just get to work* - and so I do.  But then I forget to buy the groceries I needed.  The core feature for my MVP doesn't get made becaue I was trying to make a snazzy loading animation *just in case*, despite that my does-nothing program loads in milliseconds.

The takeaway?  Making a checklist *is* work.  Does it accomplish a task?  No, of course not.  Does it make accomplishing those tasks go faster?  **Absoultely!**  This little revelation brought me back to a quote I heard:


```quote
Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.

-Abraham Lincoln
```

I get it - we all want to start chopping away, completing our tasks.  But a little structure - like a sharpened axe - makes the work go a lot faster.
